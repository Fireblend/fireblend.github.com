h1. This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/fireblend/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.
This is a fork from mojombo/mojombo.github.com repository, which was used as an initial base and template for a basic Jekyll install.
