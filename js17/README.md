# Aah! Pickpocket!
### A game by Fireblend

## About

This is a simple Javascript game developed using the [Kontra](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) micro-library, intended to be under 17kb when zipped.

The game is a tribute to asymmetric 2-player games, such as [Spy Party](http://www.spyparty.com/).

## Instructions

1 player plays as the **thief** (keyboard) and another plays as the **sheriff** (mouse).

The thief's goal is to pickpocket 3 villagers. To pickpocket a villager, talk to them for 3 consecutive seconds (conversation will occur automatically when they are close to a villager), and then press the *space*, *Q* or *E* keys. 
**Hint**: You can use the speech bubble animation to keep track of time: everytime it shows 3 dots, a second has elapsed!
The screen will go dark after each successful robbery to allow the thief to escape the scene of the crime, but the location will be visible!

The **sheriff's goal is to identify the thief, and shoot them before they can accomplish their goal!**
