# Unnamed 17kb challenge game

This is a simple Javascript game developed using the [Kontra](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) micro-library, intended to be under 17kb when zipped.

The game is a tribute to asymmetric 2-player games, such as [Spy Party](http://www.spyparty.com/).

# Instructions

1 player plays as the **assassin** (keyboard) and another plays as the **sheriff** (mouse).

The assassin's goal is to kill 3 villagers without being detected. In order to kill a villager, they must have talked to them for a total of 3 consecutive seconds (conversation will occur automatically when they are close to a villager), and then press the *space bar* key. Once killed, the screen will go dark for a short amount of time to allow them to escape the scene of the crime.

The sheriff's goal is to identify the assassin, and shoot them before they can accomplish their goal.

This game is a work in progress.
