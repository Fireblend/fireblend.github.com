		<img class="hello" src="images/pic.png" alt="Me" align="left" style="margin-top:12px"/>
		My name is Sergio. I'm a Costa Rican programmer currently working as a mobile software engineer at <a href="http://www.cecropiasolutions.com">Cecropia Solutions</a>, and a computer science M.Sc. student at <a href="http://www.tec.cr/">ITCR</a>. I enjoy making games for fun, participating at game jams and experimenting with new technology and tools as often as I can.
		<br><br>
		Among other things, I'm a sci-fi fan, a free/open software and hardware enthusiast, a photography novice, an avid reader, a traveler and a humanist.
		When not coding and listening to music, it's just the music.
