	<h1>about me</h1>
		<img class="hello" src="images/pic.png" alt="Me" align="left" style="margin-top:9px"/>
		My name is Sergio, and I live in Costa Rica. I currently split my time between working as a mobile software engineer at <a href="http://www.wearegap.com">Growth Acceleration Partners</a>, giving lectures for introductory CS courses at <a href="http://www.tec.cr/">ITCR</a>, and studying for my M.Sc. degree at the same university. I enjoy <a href="/gamedev">making games for fun</a> and toying around with new tech & tools when time allows.
		<br><br>
		Among other things, I'm a sci-fi fan, a free/open software and hardware enthusiast, a photography novice, an avid reader, a traveler and a humanist.
		When not coding and listening to music, it's just the music.
