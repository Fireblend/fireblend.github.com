	<h1>about me</h1>
		<img class="hello" src="images/pic.png" alt="Me" align="left" style="margin-top:12px"/>
		My name is Sergio. I'm a Costa Rican programmer currently working as a mobile software engineer at <a href="http://www.cecropiasolutions.com">Cecropia Solutions</a>, and a computer science M.Sc. student at <a href="http://www.tec.cr/">ITCR</a>. I enjoy making games for fun, and aim to release a successful indie game someday. Meanwhile, I participate at game jams and experiment with new technology and concepts as often as I can.
		<br><br>
		Among other things, I'm a sci-fi fan, a free/open software and hardware enthusiast, a photography novice, an avid reader, a traveler, a skeptic and a humanist. 
		If not coding and listening to music, it's just the music.
