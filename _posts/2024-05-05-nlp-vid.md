================

At this talk, we will introduce the concept of transfer learning in the context of machine learning and how it enables software developers to leverage off-the-shelf language models to accomplish NLP tasks with only a few lines of code, adding this powerful resource to any developer's toolbox without requiring specialized knowledge.

Speaker: Sergio Morales, Principal Data Engineer at GAP.

Target Audience: The audience should have a basic understanding of Python. This would be a great asset for anyone looking to explore how to integrate NLP features into their projects.

Learning Objective: This talk and demonstration will allow you to learn how to quickly and efficiently leverage ready-to-use large language models available on the Hugging Face model hub, and have them perform highly sophisticated NLP tasks, as well as how to refine them for domain-sensitive purposes as needed.
