However, I'm still very proud of it, as it's entirely playable, both <strong><a href="http://fireblend.github.com/LD25/index.html">through Flash</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g5lc5zibjtvuyfs/Fireblend%20-%20Lunar%20Frenzy.apk">Android devices</a></strong>! 

"After years of living under the shadow of puny planets, an oversized moon goes rogue, in a revenge-fueled trip across the universe with one goal only: smash all those planets into tiny little pieces. Will it succeed? Or will it fall to the many space-mines that litter the galaxy?" 

The game was made with touch controls in mind, so I strongly suggest you play the Android version if you have the chance. All comments are extremely appreciated! And don't forget to post your highscore! 

Feel free to <strong><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&amp;uid=10166">check it out</a></strong>, and greetings from Costa Rica!
