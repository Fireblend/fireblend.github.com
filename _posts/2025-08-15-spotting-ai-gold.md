Artificial intelligence is everywhere, yet for many organizations, the question isn’t if they should use AI — as the technology is now more accessible than ever and the willingness to do so at an all-time high — the real challenge is how to make it work in ways that are strategic and sustainable, embedding it into core operations to solve their most pressing challenges.

In my role as a Principal Data Engineer and subject matter expert in Data & AI, I have spent a lot of time talking with clients at different stages of their AI journey. Some are just curious, looking for their first step. Others already have bold ideas but need help making them real.

This blog shares key lessons from those conversations, how to spot AI opportunities, how to guide clients through discovery and how to turn curiosity into lasting solutions.
