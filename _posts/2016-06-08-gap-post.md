================

I haven't updated this blog in a while, but that doesn't mean nothing's happened since the last time I did! I'll be updating this site shortly with some recent projects of mine and other thoughts, but for now here's an article of mine that was recently published on the Growth Acceleration Partners (the software development company I work at) blog, about React Native for Mobile App Development, an interesting new trend in mobile development!

You can check out the article here: <strong><a href="https://www.growthaccelerationpartners.com/blog/introduction-to-react-native-for-mobile-development/">An Introduction to React Native for Mobile App Development</a></strong>.

Cheers!
