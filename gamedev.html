	<h1>games</h1>
	
	This is a gallery of experimental indie games I've either made or helped make. These were developed during special events called "game jams", which usually take place over a single weekend. Some of these (such as the Ludum Dare games) I've developed myself (which means I created all of the assets such as music and graphics within the alloted time), while others I've helped create as part of a team (as is the case for Global Game Jam games). In any case, they're all free to be played either online or on some other platform, and their code is available if you're interesting in finding out how they were made. Enjoy!
