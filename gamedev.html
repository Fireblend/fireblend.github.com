	<h1>what is this?</h1>
	This is a gallery of experimental indie games I've either made or helped make. Most of these were developed during events known as "game jams", which usually take place over a weekend. Some (such as the <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> games) I developed myself (including all of the assets such as music and graphics), while others I helped with as part of a team (as is the case for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">GGJ games</a>). In any case, they're all free to play, and their code is available if you're interested in finding out how they were made. Enjoy!
